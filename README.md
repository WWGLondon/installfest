# InstallFest Guide

Home for WWGLondon Golang installfest howto documents.
The aim is to help students to get their machine ready for our workshop.
For the current being, our step-by-step guide would be available for *Mac OSX* & *windows* machines.

A lot of these were adopted from [Bill Kennedy's blog](https://www.goinggo.net/2016/05/installing-go-and-your-workspace.html) and [Golang's official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
